# CS50-Crack
A simple solution for Harvard's CS50 Crack problem done in Rust.

I admit I used a c like solution to the problem. I'm just learning Rust though so I can't complain.
I will probably Rustify the code in another solution just for fun. Once I figure it out.
I pretty much did this so I can see how to use c or c++ libraries with Rust code.
Still getting used to the language.

Compile with
rustc crack.rs -lcrypt

Requires -lcrypt to link in the crypt library

Apparently Rust just knows to how link in c libraries if it can be linked with Clang/LLVM
At least that it my take on it for right now.
